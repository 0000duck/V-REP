RoboComp is an open-source Robotics framework providing the tools to create and modify software components that communicate through public interfaces. RoboCompâ€™s existing simulator, RCIS, is based on OpenSceneGraph technology and custom made actuators and sensor. This repository contains the prototypes of robotics simulation using V-REP that use V-REP's API to connect them to RoboComp ecosystem. Specifically, this repo consists of RoboComp components that uses V-REP as an external simulator.

**If you don't have RoboComp installed on your system, find the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp).**


# V-REP installation

To install V-REP, please follow the following instructions:

1. Download a version of EDUCATIONAL V-REP from [here](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html), according to your system specification. 
2. Unpack the compressed file to somewhere in your system. 
3. Go to the V-REP folder and run the command:
```
sudo ./vrep.sh
```

The above command will start the V-REP simulation software.
If you are not familiar with V-REP, follow our short [tutorial](https://github.com/robocomp/V-REP/blob/master/tutorial/V-REP_API.md) that cover general operational principles of the V-REP simulator or you can go through this awesome [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL38P7Q24q4XA7c0uNj0kO4or-bKhFYdIg) on YouTube that covers the same.


# Testing RoboComp.VREP Components

From here on, we assume you are familiar with RoboComp and the working of components. If not, please follow these [tutorials](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/stable/doc/README.md).

Next, we will introduce how one can test the [linefollowingVREP](https://github.com/robocomp/V-REP/tree/master/components/linefollowingVREP) component.

**Note:**  Before moving further, make sure you have RoboComp and V-REP installed on your system.

# linefollowingVREP Component

### Description

This component communicates with cameraVREP component to get images of the floor (floor is in the scene simulated on V-REP). And, using that image it determines the directions to move so as to follow the path on the floor. The below image shows the V-REP scene with the black-colored path drawn on the floor:
