RoboComp is an open-source Robotics framework providing the tools to create and modify software components that communicate through public interfaces. RoboCompâ€™s existing simulator, RCIS, is based on OpenSceneGraph technology and custom made actuators and sensor. This repository contains the prototypes of robotics simulation using V-REP that use V-REP's API to connect them to RoboComp ecosystem. Specifically, this repo consists of RoboComp components that uses V-REP as an external simulator.

> **If you don't have RoboComp installed on your system, find the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp).**


# V-REP installation

To install V-REP, please follow the following instructions:

1. Download a version of EDUCATIONAL V-REP from [here](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html), according to your system specification. 
2. Unpack the compressed file to somewhere in your system. 
3. Go to the V-REP folder and run the command:
```
sudo ./vrep.sh
```

The above command will start the V-REP simulation software.
If you are not familiar with V-REP, follow our short [tutorial](https://github.com/robocomp/V-REP/blob/master/doc/V-REP_API.md) that cover general operational principles of the V-REP simulator or you can go through this awesome [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL38P7Q24q4XA7c0uNj0kO4or-bKhFYdIg) on YouTube that covers the same.


# Testing RoboComp.VREP Components

From here on, we assume you are familiar with RoboComp and the working of components. If not, please follow these [tutorials](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/stable/doc/README.md).

Next, we will introduce how one can test the [linefollowingVREP](https://github.com/robocomp/V-REP/tree/master/components/linefollowingVREP) component.

> **Note:**  Before moving further, make sure you have RoboComp and V-REP installed on your system.

# linefollowingVREP Component

### Description

This component communicates with cameraVREP component to get images of the floor (floor is in the scene simulated on V-REP). And, using that image it determines the directions to move so as to follow the path on the floor.
The below image shows the V-REP scene with the black-colored path drawn on the floor:

![Path](./doc/images/path.png)

The linefollowingVREP component communicates with cameraVREP component to get the image of the floor, which looks like:

![camera Image](./doc/images/cameraImage.png)

Using the image (which looks like above image), linefollwingVREP component determines which direction to move, for example:
- if the black patch is in the center of image (as in the above image), implies robot has to move straight.
- if the black patch is in the right of image, implies robot has to turn right.
- if the black patch is in the left of image, implies robot has to turn left.

To turn to the determined direction, linefollowingVREP component communicates with differentialrobotVREP component.

## Testing the Component

For testing, copy the folders [*cameraVREP*](./components/cameraVREP), [*differentialrobotVREP*](./components/differentialrobotVREP), [*linefollowingVREP*](./components/linefollowingVREP) inside _robocomp/components/_.

And, the scene file for testing the component can be found [here](./components/hexapod/lineFollowerDemo.ttt).

#### Edit Configuration file

Now, to enable the linefollowingVREP component to communicate, we need to tell the linefollowingVREP component where to find the differentialrobotVREP and the cameraVREP interfaces. 

> **Note:** In the current scenario, linefollowingVREP component is a client that communicates with differentialrobotVREP and cameraVREP components.

> **You can find the port on which cameraVREP and differentialrobotVREP are hosted in _etc/config_ file inside the respective components directory.**



So, now we need to change the ports in the configuration file of linefollowingVREP components accordingly.

```
# go inside the component
cd V-REP/components/linefollowingVREP

# open the config file of the component in any editor. For example,
vim etc/config

```

Now, change the port numbers on which cameraVREP and differentialrobotVREP accordingly i.e change the port numbers in the following lines:

```python
DifferentialRobotProxy = differentialrobot:tcp -h localhost -p 10177
CameraSimpleProxy = camerasimple:tcp -h localhost -p 10178
```


> **Note: The current config files are already well setted up, so you can test the components directly**.



#### Running the component

```
cd robocomp/components/
```
Open 4 new terminals.

Terminal 1: 
```
1. Open the scene lineFollowerDemo.ttt in V-REP.
2. Now, start the scene. That will start the server with two socket at 19999, 19997.
```

Terminal 2:
```
cd differentialrobotVREP
python src/differentialrobotVREP.py --Ice.Config=etc/config
```

Terminal 3: 
```
cd cameraVREP
python src/cameraVREP.py --Ice.Config=etc/config
```

Terminal 4: 
```
cd linefollowingVREP
python src/linefollowingVREP.py --Ice.Config=etc/config
```


Now, switch to the V-REP simulator and see the robot following the path on the floor. Here, is the demo of the same:
